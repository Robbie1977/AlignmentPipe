Virtual Aligner
=============

This site contains the code for vfbaligner.inf.ed.ac.uk.

This is a Django Admin frontend for a CMTK 3D image stack alignments pipeline.

The fronetend enables users to upload and manage their alignments as they are processed by the alignment pipeline.

The alignment pipeline can be run on any number of individual (with access to same shared file store) or clustered machines.

http://vfbaligner.inf.ed.ac.uk is undergoing beta testing so contact rcourt (at) ed.ac.uk if you wish to trial the service.
